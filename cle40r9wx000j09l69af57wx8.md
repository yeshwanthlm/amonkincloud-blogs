Here are a few AWS project ideas that you could work on over the weekend:

1. Set up a static website using Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront. This project would involve creating an S3 bucket to host the website files and configuring CloudFront to distribute the website to visitors.
    
2. Create a simple backend API using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda. This project would involve creating an API endpoint using API Gateway and writing a Lambda function to handle the API requests.
    
3. Deploy a simple web application using Amazon Elastic Beanstalk. This project would involve uploading a simple web application to Elastic Beanstalk, which will handle the deployment, scaling, and management of the application.
    
4. Set up a scalable and highly available database using Amazon RDS. This project would involve creating an RDS instance and setting up read replicas and automatic failover to ensure high availability.
    
5. Create a serverless backend for a mobile app using Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and Amazon API Gateway. This project would involve setting up a DynamoDB database, writing Lambda functions to handle the API requests, and configuring API Gateway to handle the traffic to the backend.
    

Each of these projects will give you a hands-on experience with various AWS services and help you build your skills in cloud computing.
