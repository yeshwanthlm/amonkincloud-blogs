Multi-tenancy is a concept in cloud computing that allows multiple customers, or tenants, to share a single instance of a cloud service or application while keeping their data and applications isolated and secure from each other. Here is an example of how multi-tenancy works in cloud computing:

Consider a cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) application that provides project management tools to its customers. The application is hosted on a cloud provider's infrastructure and allows multiple customers to access the same application while keeping their data and projects isolated and secure.

In a multi-tenant environment, each customer's data and projects are stored in a separate partition, or logical container, within the application's database. Each customer can access their data and projects through the same user interface, but their data is kept separate from other customers' data.

The cloud provider manages the infrastructure, including servers, storage, and network resources, that are shared by all tenants of the application. The provider must ensure that each tenant's data and projects are isolated and secured from other tenants and that each tenant has sufficient resources and performance to meet their needs.

This multi-tenant approach allows the cloud provider to serve many customers using a single instance of the application, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. At the same time, it allows customers to access the same tools and resources as other tenants at a lower cost while keeping their data and projects secure and private.
