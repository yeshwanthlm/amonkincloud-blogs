Becoming a DevOps engineer requires a combination of skills, knowledge, and experience in various areas, including software development, operations, automation, and cloud technologies. Here's a 6-month plan to help you on your journey toward becoming a DevOps engineer:

### Rules:

* Minimum of 2 hours a day of deep non distracted work.
    
* Build projects every weekend.
    
* Journal everything that you study.
    
* Build a project every week with documentation.
    
* Create a blog or YouTube channel to document your learning.
    
* Throughout 6 Months learn a command every day and try to use it where ever possible. Keep 15-30 Mins/Day for Linux alone
    

### Month 1: Fundamentals of DevOps and Cloud Technologies

* Week 1: Learn the basics of DevOps, its principles, and its benefits.
    
* Week 2-3: Familiarize yourself with cloud technologies, such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Learn about their core services, computing, storage, network, and security, as well as their pricing models.
    
* Week 4: Learn about version control systems such as Git and the basics of infrastructure as code, including using tools such as Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation.
    

### Month 2: Automation and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

* Week 1-2: Get hands-on experience with automation tools such as Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, or GitLab CI/CD to build and deploy applications automatically.
    
* Week 3-4: Focus on setting up a full CI/CD pipeline that includes testing, quality checks, and deployment to production environments. Explore other CI/CD tools and platforms such as GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, and AWS CodePipeline.
    

### Month 3: Monitoring and Orchestration

* Week 1-2: Learn about monitoring and log management tools such as Nagios, Zabbix, Grafana, Prometheus, and ELK Stack. Set up monitoring for your applications and infrastructure.
    
* Week 3-4: Learn about container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes and Docker Swarm. Learn how to manage containerized applications at scale and how to set up a Kubernetes cluster on cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
    

### Month 4: Advanced Automation and Infrastructure as Code

* Week 1-2: Learn advanced automation concepts, such as using configuration management tools like Ansible or Puppet.
    
* Week 3-4: Dive deeper into Infrastructure as Code, explore AWS CDK or Azure Bicep, and create more complex infrastructure deployments.
    

### Month 5: Security and Compliance

* Week 1-2: Learn about DevOps security best practices, such as using secure coding standards, secrets management, and infrastructure hardening.
    
* Week 3-4: Learn about compliance frameworks, such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, and SOC 2. Understand how to implement DevOps practices in a compliant environment.
    

### Month 6: Real-World Experience and Continuous Learning

* Week 1-2: Participate in a real-world project, such as contributing to an open-source project or collaborating on an internal project.
    
* Week 3-4: Attend a DevOps conference or meetup to learn about the latest trends and practices in the field.
    

Remember that becoming a DevOps engineer is a continuous learning process, and this 6-month plan is just the beginning. Continue to learn new technologies, collaborate with teams, and participate in open-source projects to deepen your knowledge and experience. Good luck!
