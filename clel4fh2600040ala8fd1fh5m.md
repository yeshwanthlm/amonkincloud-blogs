I have recently received an important distinction. I received a message from **AWS** saying *"You‚Äôre exactly the kind of person we‚Äôre looking for, and I‚Äôm thrilled to invite you to participate in our* [*AWS Community Builders*](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/) *program for the* ***next 12 months"***

My work and willingness to share information about Cloud Computing have been noticed, which is extremely good.

It is a great honor for me to be **AWS Community Builder**. Because the number of holders of this title worldwide is limited each year.

## How did I Become an AWS Community Builder?

Honestly, I'm not sure how that happened. Yes, I know this isn‚Äôt the answer you‚Äôve been waiting for, so let me explain what I did. So I filled out the application form and that was the end of it. After a while, I received the good news that I was exactly the person they were looking for and I was invited to participate in the AWS Community Builders program.

What made them accept me? I'm not sure because there are no formal admittance requirements. But I did/did it...
