High Availability (HA) is a system design approach that aims to ensure a high level of operational uptime and minimize downtime by having redundancy and failover mechanisms in place. In other words, it means that the system is designed to continue operating even if one or more components fail.

Let's take the example of a web application that serves as an online marketplace for buying and selling goods. The application runs on a cluster of web servers, and there's a load balancer that distributes the incoming traffic to the servers.

To ensure high availability, the system is designed with the following components:

1. Load balancer: The load balancer distributes the incoming traffic to multiple web servers, so if one server fails, the load balancer can redirect the traffic to another server. This way, even if one server fails, the application can continue to serve the users.
    
2. Web servers: The web servers are configured in a cluster, which means that there are multiple instances of the application running simultaneously. If one web server goes down, the other servers in the cluster can continue serving the users.
    
3. Database: The database is configured with master-slave replication, which means that there are multiple copies of the database running simultaneously. If the master database goes down, the slave database can take over and continue serving the application.
    
4. Monitoring and alerting: The system is configured with monitoring and alerting tools that can notify the system administrators if any component of the system fails. This way, the administrators can quickly take action to fix the problem and restore the system.
    

By having these components in place, the system can ensure high availability and minimize downtime. For example, if one of the web servers goes down, the load balancer can redirect the traffic to the other servers in the cluster, and the users won't even notice that there was a problem. Similarly, if the master database goes down, the slave database can take over, and the application can continue to operate without any interruption. This way, the system can continue to serve the users even if one or more components fail, and provide a seamless user experience.
