Here are some AWS + IoT hardware project ideas that you can consider:

1. Smart Home Automation: Build a smart home automation system using an IoT device, such as a Raspberry Pi, that can communicate with AWS IoT. You can create custom rules to automate various tasks, such as turning on/off lights, adjusting temperature, and controlling appliances.
    
2. Environmental Monitoring: Create an environmental monitoring system that can track temperature, humidity, air quality, and other environmental factors using an IoT device connected to AWS IoT. You can use AWS Lambda to process the data and send alerts when thresholds are exceeded.
    
3. Agriculture Monitoring: Develop an agriculture monitoring system that can track soil moisture, temperature, and other factors using an IoT device connected to AWS IoT. You can use AWS DynamoDB to store the data and AWS S3 to store images captured by the device's camera.
    
4. Smart Parking System: Build a smart parking system using an IoT device that can detect vehicle presence and communicate with AWS IoT. You can use AWS Lambda to process the data and provide real-time parking availability information to users.
    
5. Asset Tracking: Create an asset tracking system that can track the location and movement of assets, such as vehicles or equipment, using GPS-enabled IoT devices connected to AWS IoT. You can use AWS Lambda to process the data and provide real-time tracking information to users.
    
6. Wearable Health Monitoring: Develop a wearable health monitoring system using an IoT device that can track vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, and communicate with AWS IoT. You can use AWS Lambda to process the data and provide alerts when thresholds are exceeded.
    

These are just a few examples of AWS + IoT hardware project ideas that you can consider. The possibilities are endless, and you can use your creativity to come up with innovative solutions that address real-world challenges.
