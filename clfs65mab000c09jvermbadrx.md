Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable object storage service that can store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. Some common use cases for Amazon S3 include:

1. Backup and archiving: Amazon S3 provides a highly durable and scalable backup and archiving solution that can store data for long periods.
    
2. Web and mobile applications: Developers can use Amazon S3 to store and serve static assets such as images, videos, and documents for web and mobile applications.
    
3. Big data analytics: Amazon S3 is often used as a data lake for big data analytics, providing a central repository for structured and unstructured data.
    
4. Disaster recovery: Amazon S3 can be used as a disaster recovery solution, allowing businesses to store backups of critical data in a highly durable and available storage system.
    

Amazon S3 differs from other AWS storage services like EBS (Elastic Block Store) and EFS (Elastic File System) in several ways:

1. Object storage vs block storage: Amazon S3 provides object storage, which means that data is stored as objects rather than blocks. This makes it a better fit for storing unstructured data such as media files, documents, and backups.
    
2. Durability and availability: Amazon S3 provides a high level of durability and availability, with data automatically replicated across multiple availability zones. This makes it a good choice for mission-critical applications that require high levels of availability.
    
3. Pricing model: Amazon S3 uses a pay-as-you-go pricing model based on the amount of data stored and the amount of data transferred in and out of the service. EBS and EFS, on the other hand, use a more traditional pricing model based on the amount of storage provisioned.
