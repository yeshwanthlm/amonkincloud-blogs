AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run your code in response to events or triggers, without needing to provision, manage, or scale any servers. Here are some of the key benefits of using AWS Lambda:

1. Cost-effective: With AWS Lambda, you only pay for the compute time that you consume, without any upfront or ongoing infrastructure costs. This can result in significant cost savings, especially for applications with infrequent or variable workloads.
    
2. Scalability: AWS Lambda automatically scales your application in response to changes in demand, without any manual intervention required. This allows you to handle spikes in traffic or sudden increases in workload without worrying about capacity planning or provisioning.
    
3. Flexibility: AWS Lambda supports a wide range of programming languages, including Node.js, Python, Java, and C#. This allows you to choose the language that best fits your use case or skill set, and to easily switch between languages as your needs evolve.  
    Rapid development: AWS Lambda allows you to quickly build and deploy code without needing to manage infrastructure. This can reduce development time and accelerate the time to market for new applications or features.
    
4. Integration: AWS Lambda can easily integrate with other AWS services, such as Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Kinesis, allowing you to build powerful and scalable applications that leverage the full power of the AWS ecosystem.
    

**AWS Lambda differs from other AWS compute services like EC2 and ECS in several ways.**

1. Serverless: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service, which means that you don't need to manage or provision any servers. This makes it easier to develop, deploy, and scale your applications and can result in cost savings compared to traditional server-based architectures.
    
2. Event-driven: AWS Lambda is event-driven, which means that it responds to triggers or events, such as changes in data or the arrival of a message, rather than running continuously. This allows you to build highly responsive and scalable applications that can quickly process large amounts of data.
    
3. Statelessness: AWS Lambda functions are stateless, which means that they don't retain any information between invocations. This can simplify development and testing, but also means that you need to manage state outside of your Lambda functions, using other AWS services such as S3 or DynamoDB.
    
4. Limited runtimes: AWS Lambda supports a limited set of programming languages and runtime environments, compared to other AWS compute services like EC2 or ECS. However, this set is growing all the time, and Lambda now supports many popular programming languages and frameworks.
