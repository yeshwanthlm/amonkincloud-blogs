AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables customers to transfer files over Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS), and File Transfer Protocol (FTP) directly in and out of Amazon S3 or Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). It simplifies the process of migrating file transfer workflows to AWS, and eliminates the need to run and maintain infrastructure such as FTP servers or VPN connections.

AWS Transfer Family is different from traditional servers in a number of technical ways. Here are some of the key differences:

1. Fully managed service: AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service, which means that AWS takes care of the underlying infrastructure, including security patches, software updates, and scaling. Customers only pay for the resources they use, without having to worry about the operational overhead of setting up and maintaining traditional servers.
    
2. Integration with AWS services: AWS Transfer Family is designed to integrate seamlessly with other AWS services, including Amazon S3, Amazon EFS, AWS Lambda, and Amazon CloudWatch. This provides customers with a comprehensive and scalable solution for file transfer that can be easily integrated into their existing AWS environments.
    
3. Secure protocols: AWS Transfer Family supports secure file transfer protocols such as SFTP, FTPS, and FTP over SSL/TLS. This ensures that data is transferred securely over the internet, without the need for a VPN connection.
    
4. Scalability: AWS Transfer Family is highly scalable, allowing customers to easily increase or decrease capacity based on their needs. This is achieved through the use of AWS Auto Scaling, which automatically adjusts capacity based on demand.
    
5. Availability: AWS Transfer Family provides high availability and durability, with data being stored in multiple Availability Zones within a region to provide resiliency and protection against data loss.
    

Overall, AWS Transfer Family provides a highly scalable, secure, and fully managed solution for file transfer, without the operational overhead associated with setting up and maintaining traditional servers.
